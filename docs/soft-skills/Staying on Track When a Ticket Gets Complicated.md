You start working on a ticket thinking it’ll be done in a day or two. But then… things get complicated. Something doesn’t work. Docs aren’t clear. You fix one thing, and two new problems show up.

Don’t worry — it happens to all of us. Here are some simple and helpful tips to keep moving when a ticket starts dragging on.

## 1. **Start on Your Own — But Know When to Ask for Help**

The first step is to *try*. Explore the codebase. Search your organization’s repositories — maybe a similar problem has already been solved. Consult the framework or library documentation. Use AI tools for assistance.

There’s a point where continuing alone becomes counterproductive. Recognizing that point is a skill in itself. If you're hitting the same wall repeatedly, it's time to reach out — whether it’s to a teammate, another team, or someone who has context on the problem.

Asking for help isn’t a weakness — it’s a way to unlock progress.

## 2. **Split the Work: Essential vs. Optional**

Sometimes, the technical challenge lies in an *optional* part of the ticket — maybe a UI optimization, a secondary integration, or a refactor that seemed small at the beginning. Don’t let that part hold the entire delivery hostage.

Instead, break the ticket down:

* Finish the essential part.
* Document your current state on the challenging piece.
* Create a follow-up ticket.
* Move it to the backlog for later.

This allows the team to make progress without losing sight of the long-term goal.

## 3. **Take a Break — Seriously**

It sounds simple, but it’s powerful.

Call it a day. Sign off early if you’re feeling overwhelmed and start fresh the next morning. 
I’ve lost count of how many times a challenge in the late evening showed its solution the next morning.

Your brain sometimes just needs rest — not more effort.

## 4. **Communicate Early**

If a ticket has been in progress for a while and it’s starting to look risky for the sprint, don’t wait for someone to ask — be proactive.

In your pull request, acknowledge the limitations. Suggest reasonable improvements that can be done now, and propose follow-ups for the rest. When reviewers see that you’ve thought about trade-offs and already scoped future work, they’re more likely to be pragmatic — rather than push for perfection at the cost of timelines.

Include a note like:

> “This implementation covers X and Y. Z requires more investigation and is tracked in ticket ABC-123. Happy to discuss if needed.”

Setting expectations helps your reviewers focus on what matters *now*.
