Despite years of recommendations, TDD still isn’t mainstream. But that doesn’t mean testing itself has to be dull or mechanical.
In fact, testing becomes much more enjoyable when you understand the tools and purpose behind it.



## Read the Testing Documentation of the Technology You Use

Most developers learn testing by example — copy, paste, and tweak until it works.
That approach makes tests *pass*, but it rarely makes testing *fun*.

If you’re using Spring, start by reading the [official Spring Testing documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/testing.html). 
It’s packed with techniques that can make testing easier and more enjoyable — from using `@SpringBootTest` and `@DataJpaTest` to 
slicing tests for web layers and configuring test-specific profiles with `@ActiveProfiles`.

Understanding these tools changes the mindset from *“I just want this test to pass”* to *“I know exactly how to test this part efficiently.”*
Once you know your options — mock beans, test configurations, profiles, transaction management, and embedded databases — testing feels less like work and more like craftsmanship.

## At Least Cover the Essentials

Not every team can or will practice strict TDD — and that’s fine.
But at the very least, make sure you have tests that cover the *essential scenarios*:
critical paths, business rules, and integration points.

Even without test-first development, a solid set of regression tests ensures confidence in your system’s core behavior.

## Under Time Constraints? Focus on Integration Tests

When deadlines are tight, it’s tempting to skip testing altogether. Instead, shift your focus to **integration tests**.
They offer the most value per minute spent — verifying that components actually work together and the system behaves as expected.
Later, you can refine coverage with unit tests when time allows.

## Remember: Tests Are Not for Now — They’re for the Future

Tests are not written just to prove that your code works *today*.
They exist to protect it *tomorrow*.
Every future change, refactor, or optimization should have a safety net to ensure nothing breaks existing functionality. That’s when tests show their real value.

Even if you don’t practice full-blown TDD, **read the docs**, **cover the essentials**, and **focus on the future**.

Once you understand your testing tools and their purpose, you’ll find that writing tests can be one of the most creative and satisfying parts of development.
