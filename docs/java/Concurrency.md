Got it! Here's the improved blog post structure:

- The first part stays focused purely on **basic thread pools** (`ExecutorService`, `ThreadFactory`)
- Then a clear **transition** introduces the `ForkJoinPool.commonPool()` as a **distinct section**, explaining what it is, where it shows up, and why it matters.

## üîß Mastering Thread Pools in Java: `ExecutorService` and `ThreadFactory`

When building concurrent applications in Java, managing threads properly is crucial. Spawning raw threads (`new Thread(...)`) works for simple cases, but it's inefficient and hard to scale. Java‚Äôs concurrency package offers a more powerful approach: **thread pools**.

This post will walk you through the fundamentals of using `ExecutorService` and customizing threads with `ThreadFactory`. Then we‚Äôll explore a special thread pool used behind the scenes‚Äî`ForkJoinPool.commonPool()`.

### üîÑ Why Use Thread Pools?

Thread pools reuse threads instead of creating new ones for each task. This means:
- Better performance (less time creating/destroying threads)
- Controlled concurrency (limits how many threads run at once)
- Cleaner code (no manual thread lifecycle management)

---

### üöÄ Using `ExecutorService`

`ExecutorService` is the most common way to use thread pools in Java:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class PoolExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);

        executor.submit(() -> {
            System.out.println("Task 1 executed by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        });

        executor.submit(() -> {
            System.out.println("Task 2 executed by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        });

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

‚òëÔ∏è You can choose from:
- `newFixedThreadPool(int n)`
- `newCachedThreadPool()`
- `newSingleThreadExecutor()`

Each comes with trade-offs depending on your workload (CPU-bound, I/O-bound, etc.).

### üßµ Customizing Threads with `ThreadFactory`

Need more control over thread naming or daemon settings? Use a `ThreadFactory`.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory;

ThreadFactory factory = r -> {
    Thread t = new Thread(r);
    t.setName("worker-" + t.getId());
    return t;
};
```

You can pass this factory into your executor:

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2, factory);
```

This is super helpful for debugging and log tracing.

## üîç What is `ForkJoinPool.commonPool()`?

Now that we‚Äôve covered the basics, let‚Äôs look at a special thread pool that Java uses behind the scenes: the **common ForkJoinPool**.

### üß† Overview

`ForkJoinPool.commonPool()` is a shared thread pool automatically used by:
- `parallelStream()`
- `CompletableFuture.runAsync()` and `supplyAsync()` (when no custom executor is provided)
- Fork/Join Framework (e.g., `RecursiveTask`, `RecursiveAction`)

It‚Äôs built for **parallelism**, using a **work-stealing algorithm** that makes it efficient at handling many small tasks.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è How Big Is It?

By default, the pool size = `Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() - 1`.

This ensures the main thread stays free, and worker threads match your system‚Äôs CPU capacity.

---

### üëÄ Example: Parallel Streams

```java
List<Integer> numbers = List.of(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8);

int sum = numbers.parallelStream()
    .peek(n -> System.out.println("Processing " + n + " on " + Thread.currentThread().getName()))
    .mapToInt(Integer::intValue)
    .sum();
```

Output:
```
Processing 3 on thread: ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-1
Processing 4 on thread: ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-3
...
```

That‚Äôs the common pool in action‚Äîeven though you never configured it yourself.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è When to Avoid It

The `commonPool` works great for **non-blocking CPU-bound tasks**, but you **should not use it for blocking I/O or long-running tasks**, because:
- It has a limited number of threads
- If all are blocked, other tasks will starve

üõ† **Solution**: Use your own `ExecutorService` for blocking tasks:

```java
CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> slowOperation(), customExecutor);
```

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

- Use `ExecutorService` to manage threads explicitly and safely.
- Customize with `ThreadFactory` for better thread naming and control.
- Understand that `ForkJoinPool.commonPool()` is used implicitly in parallel streams and `CompletableFuture`.
- Avoid blocking the common pool‚Äîuse dedicated executors for I/O-heavy tasks.
