If you‚Äôve ever set a breakpoint in your IDE and stepped through some Java code, you might have assumed you were literally running that source line by line.

Not quite.

In Java, what you *see* in the debugger isn‚Äôt always what the JVM is actually executing. The source is just a **map** to what‚Äôs really happening under the hood. And this works differently depending on whether you‚Äôre debugging **your own project‚Äôs code** or **a dependency you pulled in with Maven**.

Let‚Äôs dig in.

## Java: Your Code vs. Library Code

### Your own project‚Äôs code

When you write `.java` files and build your app (say with Maven or Gradle), those files are **compiled into bytecode** (`.class` files).

* At runtime, the JVM executes the `.class` files.
* The `.java` source files aren‚Äôt executed directly.
* Your IDE shows you the source by mapping bytecode back to your original lines (using debug info from compilation).
* That‚Äôs why if you run your Spring Boot app directly from your IDE, breakpoints ‚Äújust work‚Äù ‚Äî the compiler generated `.class` files are right there alongside your source.

### Dependencies (JAR libraries)

The same principle applies to the libraries you depend on ‚Äî like Spring Framework itself or any other Maven artifact:

* Maven downloads **only the JARs** (compiled `.class` files).
* If you don‚Äôt attach the `*-sources.jar`, your IDE decompiles the bytecode so you can still set breakpoints.
* With the source JAR attached, you see the *actual* code the library authors wrote, and breakpoints map perfectly.

**In both cases, the JVM is executing bytecode, not source. The source is just there for you, the developer, to make sense of it and debug effectively.**

## Python: Running the Source for Real

Python works very differently:

* Python runs `.py` source files directly.
* It may generate `.pyc` bytecode caches, but those are just for speed.
* Breakpoints literally pause inside the real source file.

No source? No runtime. In Python, the `.py` files are the truth.

## JavaScript: Source Execution (Until Bundling Gets Involved)

JavaScript behaves more like Python:

* Node.js and browsers execute `.js` files directly.
* Breakpoints stop in the actual source lines.
* The only complication comes when bundlers or minifiers transform code ‚Äî then you need **source maps** to debug the original source (TypeScript, ES6, etc.).

## Why This Matters for Debugging

* **Java (your code + libraries):** the JVM executes bytecode, while your IDE shows you source (yours directly, or libraries via attached/decompiled sources).
* **Python and JavaScript:** the runtime directly executes your source files, and breakpoints stop in the real code.

So when you hit a breakpoint in Java ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs in your own service class or deep inside a Spring dependency ‚Äî remember: the source you see is an *illusion*. The JVM is faithfully executing bytecode.
